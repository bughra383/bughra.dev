I’m a Computer Programming student passionate about Penetration Testing, Web Application Security, and hands-on cybersecurity challenges. I develop with Python, JavaScript, and Go, and enhance my skills through Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges.

As an active member of my university’s Free Software and Open Source community, I help organize events and promote open-source culture.

I aim to deepen my expertise in Penetration Testing, Malware Analysis, System and Network Administration to become a well-rounded cybersecurity professional. Beyond tech, I enjoy music (especially Massive Attack), technical books, Counter Strike 1.6, and TTRPGs.
